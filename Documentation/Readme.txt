General Description:
	Purpose:
	The purpose of this project is to simulate a medical therapy device called OasisPro. The device functions to aleviate pain
	through providing the user with Cranio-Electro Stimulation (CES). The CES (session type determines the frequency/nature of the pulse)
	is administered to the user for a certain time period (called a group) using electrodes connected to earlobes. 
	The project simulates the physical device through an interface built using the Qt C++ framework.
	The device design in this project does not reconstitute all of the functionality of the original device (also has functionality
	that the original device does not have) but comes close to it.
	
	Differences from the actual device:	
	Some of the differences betweeen the actual device and this application simulating it include:
	1. Although the actual device has many sessions (including custom) and groups, this simulation has only 3 groups (20s, 45s and user defined) and
	   4 sessions ("ALPHA", "DELTA", "THETA", "MET"). The user defined group lets session go on until the user stops the session by turning off the device.
	2. The simulation has extra buttons: A button marked "T" that the user can use to change between groups (in the original device the power button
	   acheives this functionality) and a record button which enables the user to record details of ran sessions (in the original device there is no
	   recording feature).
	3. The simulation has a "Session on" icon which turns on when a session is started/is running. The original device does not have this icon and displays
	   a "softOn" annimation when a session is selected for running. We found the icon approach to be better for programming purposes as many annimations 
	   increase the chance of interference between various displays (often time same icons are used in the original device to display different things such
	   as battery display, intensity, connection status and etc. Please see the "Issues" section of this document for further explanation). 
	4. The original device automatically turns off when a session is not selected withing 2 minutes. Though it would have been easy to implement this feature
	   in the simulation (by using a Qt singleshot timer), we decided not to. The decision was based on the fact that the natural draining of the battery 
	   would essentially acheve this. Also, since in the simulation we consider a 20 second session to be a 20 min session and 45 second session to be a 
	   45 min session, turning the device off after 2 seconds would not give enough time for the user to go through sessions and groups and make a selection.
	5. In the original device all sessions end with a "softOff" animation. We made a slight change to this in the our application. In our application,
	   if the session ends naturally (i.e. to completion 20s or 45s) "softOff" does not take place. Rather, just the "Session On" icon turns off. On the other
	   hand if the session is interrupted (user presses the power button while the session is still running), "SoftOff" animation takes place (notice that all
	   sessions running for a "user defined" time group must end in "SoftOff" since the only way to end them is to press the power button or wait till the 
           battery runs out). This decision was made to distinguish between interrupted sessions and sessions that go to completion.
	6. In the original device some button functionalities invlove pressing and holding the button for a few seconds to achieve a task. In this program this feature was
 	   not implemented. All buttons function by just pressing and releasing them (the released() signal for buttons in signal and slots mechanism).
	
	All these changes were discussed with the professor and approved by him.

	General use instructions:
	The ui created by Qt resembles the physical device with the changes discussed above. It has buttons that are clickable. In addition, the ui has an 
	area (admin area of sorts) designed for simulating the charging of the battery and attachment of electrodes to the earlobes. The battery can be "charged" 
        by essentially setting its value in the QDoubleSpinBox when the device is off. Connection of the electrodes to the earlobes is simulated by the user selecting the
	connection status from the QComboBox (three options: "No  connection", "Okay connection", "Excellent connection"). The physical device is simulated by
	a png scaffold that contains buttons (pngs), icons (pngs) and a display (QList) where recorded sessions can be viewed.
	A user can start using the device by checking the battery level then turning it on by pressing the power button. Subsequently, the user can change betweeen
	groups (times for therapy) by pressing the button marked by "T" (default group is 20s). The "user designed" group lets the session run for indefinate amount  
	of time. In this case the session is stopped either when battery runs out or when the user turns off the device. One of the four available sessions can be chosen by pressing 
	the up/down arrow buttons (default session is "ALPHA"). The select button starts the chosen session if connection is not "No  connection". While the session is running
	the up/down arrow buttons can be used to change the intensity of session, and the select button can be used to save a prefered intensity for that particular
	session. The battery depletion of the device is dependent on time (machine is on OR session is running), intensity and contact of the electrodes. The battery
	level can be monitored in two ways (it is displayed when the device is turned on and subsequently displayed periodically at pre-set battery levels during the 
	running of a session and it can be monitored outside of the physical device (in the admin area) in a QDoubleSpinBox). QDoubleSpinBox way of tracking the battery is more percise since
	the value of the battery (value between 0 and 100) is displayed/updated in real-time. The connection test is displayed as described in the manual of Oasis Pro. In this application,
	the test is done every time a session is started. The sessions go on for their predetermined amount of time (groups: 20s, 45s, user defined). User defined sessions 
	last indefinatly until the user turns the machine off or the battery runs out. When session is on, "session on" icon turns on and when it stops, the icon turns off.
	When the session is stopped by the user turning the device off, a "Soft off" animation takes place (bar graph scrolling from 8 to 1). The device will shut down if battery runs out
	(independent if session is running or not).

Explantion of the design:	
	Patterns implemented: 
		Observer: (Qt signals and slots):This pattern was extensively used to connect and update the various components of the system.
		State: the Mainwindow class changes its behaviour when internal state changes (attributes such as sessonStatus, powerStatus) are altered.
		Singleton: only one instance of MainWindow class is created.
		Antipattern: code is not modular and all of it is concentrated in 2 classes.
	
	The program consists of two classes that are responsible for simulating the function of the OasisPro device (please see UML diagram). The MainWindow class essentially represents
	all the wiring/programming inside the actual OasisPro device. The session class is responsible for the 4 different therapies that are available on the 
	current simulation of the device. The MainWindow class has a QList that holds four instances of the sessions (pointers to them). This design (composition) allows to save
	a prefered intensity for each session by having an appropriate attribute (preferedIntensity) inside the session class.
	The program logic is facilitiated by largely boolean atributes that represent the state of the device at any given instance. Based on the state of these values, the system 
	decides how to behave (which buttons will be enabled/disabled, which icons will be turned on/off, which timers will be started/stopped and etc.) (please see sequence diagrams).
	Battery depletion is simulated by a function connected to a QTimer instance that calls this function every second when the device is turned on. The various attributes of the
	program (such as power status, session status, connection status) determine the rate at which the battery (an attribute of type double) is depleted inside this function
	every second. The simulation of a the running of a session is also achieved with the help of a QTimer instance. Every time a session is started, this timer is started 
	which calls a function every second. The function keeps track of elapsed time since a session is started. This function also does the recording of session details (again 
	based on a boolean value informing the system if recording is required). The sequence diagrams demonstrate the flow of logic (and function calls) during the described activites 
	above (please see sequence diagrams).

	 

Issues:
	Interference of the displays of various objects/functions:		
		The nature of the device (and timers in qt) makes it possible interfence between displays of various parameters of
		the machine to occur.
		Sometimes the connection test result interferes with the battery display. There may also be interferences 
		between intensity display and battery display. This was ran by the professor who acknowledged the issue and approved the design.

	Timing of pressing the buttons:
		At times when buttons are pressed very quickly (> 1/sec), the display does not catch up fast enough. This issue was also brought up to the 
		professor, who aknowledged it and said it was fine.
	
	Pressing lots of buttons quickly:
		This may result in laggyness. Again, this issue was brought up to the professor, who aknowledged it and said it was fine.


Improvements:
	Make code more modular:
		Currently the program is composed of two classes (excluding QT objects/classes). It would be a better design to break the code up
		into appropriate classes. This way if extra features are added to the device in the future it would be easier to modify the code 
		to accomodate these additions.
	Follow the Model-View-Controller principle: 
		Design the application in such a way where the ui (view) is separate from the device. This will allow for easier modification of the 
		device logic in case a need arises to.
	Implement Qt layouts for the ui:
		This would let the system to respond better when the mainwindow is resized by the user. Currently, the window is not responsive.
